This project is inspired by and based on [Cold-Turkey-Pro-Activator-](https://github.com/Jaat2727/Cold-Turkey-Pro-Activator-) by [Jaat2727](https://github.com/Jaat2727).

My project provides an improved and more robust solution for enabling the PRO features of Cold Turkey Blocker.  It incorporates the core logic for accessing the Cold Turkey database but includes enhancements such as:

*   More comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes.
*   Safer database operations to avoid data corruption.
*   Improved user feedback during the activation process.
